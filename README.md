## Banglore House Price Prediction

This web application utilizes a linear prediction model to analyze the Bengaluru Houses Price dataset, which can be accessed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data). Additionally, it draws inspiration from a project by Dhaval Patel featured on his YouTube channel, codebasics.

The trained model can predict the price of a house based on criteria such as location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and lot size. It's important to note that the predictions are valid only for specific areas of Bangalore, India.
